# countryboundaries

Java library to enable fast offline reverse country geocoding: Find out the country / state in which a geo position is located.

It is well tested, does not have any dependencies, works well on Android and most importantly, is very fast.

Requires Java 8.

## Usage

Add [`de.westnordost:countryboundaries:1.5`](https://maven-repository.com/artifact/de.westnordost/countryboundaries/1.5) as a Maven dependency or download the jar from there.

```java
// load data. You should do this once and use CountryBoundaries as a singleton.
CountryBoundaries boundaries = CountryBoundaries.load(new FileInputStream("boundaries.ser"));
	
// get country ids by position
boundaries.getIds(-96.7954, 32.7816); // returns "US-TX","US"

// check if a position is in a country
boundaries.isIn(8.6910, 47.6973, "DE"); // returns true

// get which country ids can be found within the given bounding box
boundaries.getIntersectingIds(5.9865, 50.7679, 6.0599, 50.7358) // returns "DE", "BE", "NL, "EU"

// get which country ids completely cover the given bounding box
boundaries.getContainingIds(5.9865, 50.7679, 6.0599, 50.7358) // returns only "EU"
```

The default data file is in `/data/`. Don't forget to give attribution when distributing it.

## Speed

With the default data set, you can expect each call to take something between 0.1 to 0.5 ms and loading the data to take about 1 second - tested on my Sony Xperia Z1 Compact (Android phone from 2014). What makes it that fast is because the boundaries are split up into a raster. In the default data, I used a raster of 180x180 (= one cell is 2° in longitude, 1° in latitude).
If you need it even faster (down to below 0.1 ms), you need to import the data set into a bigger raster, see below. The bigger the raster, the larger the file, of course.

## Data

What exactly is returned when calling `getIds` is dependent on the data set used. The default data set in `/data/` is generated from [this file in the JOSM project](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/export/HEAD/josm/trunk/resources/data/boundaries.osm). It...
- uses ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes where available and otherwise ISO 3166-2 for subdivision codes. The data set includes subdivisions for Australia, Azerbaijan, Canada, China, Spain, France, India, Netherlands, Norway, Oman, Serbia, Russia, Ukraine, United States (but some of these subdivisons have their own ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, which are preferred by our code).
- is oblivious of sea borders and will only return correct results for geo positions on land. If you are a pirate and want to know when you reached international waters, don't use this data!

You can import own data from a GeoJson or an OSM XML, using the Java application in the `/generator/` folder. See the source code there for details, it's not that much.
